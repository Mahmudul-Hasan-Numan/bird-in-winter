                <h2>Bohemian Waxwing</h2>
                <p>This is common in winter in the northwest and northern Rocky Mountain regions. These birds will
                    eagerly
                    flock to fruit trees in the winter, and
                    they will also dive into the snow for water. Backyard birders can attract them in great numbers by
                    offering a heated bird bath for liquid water in the winter.</p>

                <h2> Northern Cardinal</h2>
                <p>The northern cardinal is one of the most popular winter backyard birds.These birds prefer black oil
                    sunflower seed and safflower seed,
                    though in the winter they are also partial to suet blocks with mixed seed and fruit. Northern
                    cardinals will also appreciate a heated bird bath for winter water.</p>

                <h2>American Robin</h2>
                <p>Many people consider the American robin as one of the first spring birds.While they are migratory
                    throughout Canada, they will also stay in parts of that summer range if conditions are
                    right.Offering fruit in feeders or leaving fruit on trees throughout the winter will provide a
                    favored food source.</p>

                <h2>Red-Breasted Nuthatch</h2>
                <p>The red-breasted nuthatch is a year-round resident throughout Canada and the western mountain regions
                    and upper Appalachian Mountains of the United States, but it can be found throughout the United
                    States in the winter months.</p>

                <h2>Tufted Titmouse</h2>
                <p>the tufted titmouse are more likely to visit feeders in the winter months, where they prefer seeds,
                    suet
                    and peanuts. These are also bold birds that can be hand fed, though the western titmice – juniper,
                    oak, black-crested, and bridled – are less apt to become tame. Western variations are also less
                    widespread.</p>

                <h2>Dark-Eyed Junco</h2>
                <p>The dark-eyed junco is so popular in the winter it is frequently called a "snowbird." The plainer
                    slate-colored bird is the most popular dark-eyed junco in the eastern United States., However, white
                    proso millet is their favorite food, and
                    they prefer it from ground feeders or low platforms.</p>

                <h2>Downy Woodpecker</h2>
                <p>These birds will visit feeders more frequently in the winter, however, particularly for suet mixes.
                    Leaving weed stalks and sunflower stalks up in the winter will also attract these birds, and they
                    will also use bird roost boxes on cold nights.</p>

                <h2>Snow Bunting</h2>
                <p>The snow bunting migrates to spend winters in southern Canada and the northern United States.They
                    will flutter into the snow for winter baths.
                    Backyard birders can encourage snow buntings to visit not only with the proper food, but also by
                    planting low, brushy shrubs to provide attractive roosting areas.</p>

                <h2>Mountain Chickadee</h2>
                <p>Chickadees will visit bird feeders for seed and seed-suet mixes, and in fact chickadees are some of
                    the easiest winter birds to attract. The black-capped chickadee, the most common northern chickadee,
                    as well as the southeastern Carolina chickadee. All of
                    these lively birds will forage in trees with quick flits and jumps from branch to branch.</p>

                <h2>California Quail</h2>
                <p> In winter, they can be found in large flocks foraging in fields
                    and visiting feeders where seeds spill on the ground. At night, these birds will cuddle together in
                    a tight roost to conserve heat.
                    Providing the right food and sufficient shelter is key to attracting backyard quail in summer and
                    winter.</p>

                <h2>Pine Siskin</h2>
                <p>The pine siskin winter range is generally restricted to southern Canada and the extreme northern
                    United States, this small finch has large irruption years when populations may spread as far south
                    as Mexico. These birds often form large flocks and they will mix with American goldfinches and
                    lesser goldfinches.</p>

                <h2>House Sparrow</h2>
                <p>The house sparrow bring lively flocking behavior to even the most isolated winter feeders.Some
                    birders, however, prefer to discourage house sparrows because they are an invasive species in North
                    America and can be bullies toward native birds.</p>
